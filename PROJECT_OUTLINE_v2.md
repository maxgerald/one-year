# ONE YEAR - Project Outline

**Version:** 2.0  
**Last Updated:** December 31, 2025

## 🎯 Project Vision

A financial literacy tool that helps people understand and discuss economic changes across generations by introducing a new unit of measurement: **1Y (One Year)** = one median worker's annual salary.

By normalizing everything to "years of work" instead of dollars, we bypass inflation confusion and make economic reality visceral and personal.

---

## 🎭 Two-Act Structure

### **Act 1: The Personal Hook** (Primary Experience)
*"Why can't I afford what my parents could?"*

**Purpose:** Build trust and personal connection through relatable purchasing power comparisons
**Tone:** Educational, empathetic, "let's figure this out together"
**Focus:** Individual worker's purchasing power across time

**Key Message:** "Your grandparents weren't better with money. The math was just different."

### **Act 2: The Context** (Secondary Discovery)
*"Oh... THAT'S where it went"*

**Purpose:** Contextualize personal economic squeeze within systemic wealth concentration
**Tone:** Factual but sharp, data-driven revelation
**Focus:** Wealth inequality and concentration over same time period

**Key Message:** "Worker productivity tripled. Wages stayed flat. The economy grew. Where did it go?"

---

## 🔑 Core Innovation: The 1Y (One Year) Unit

### **Definition:**
- **1Y** = One median worker's annual salary for that year
- Always normalized to contemporary prices
- Represents actual TIME of worker's life

### **Why Median Income?**
We use **median** (not mean/average) because:
- Mean income is inflated 37% by wealthy outliers
- Median represents what the **typical** worker actually earns
- 50% earn more, 50% earn less - it's the true middle
- Government standard (Census Bureau, BLS use median for this reason)
- Impossible for billionaires to skew the calculation

### **Current 1Y Values (December 2025):**

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Median Individual FT Earnings** | $63,128/year | BLS Q3 2025 |
| **Median Household Income** | $83,730/year | Census 2024 |
| **Federal Minimum Wage (FT)** | $15,080/year | $7.25/hr × 2080 |

**Primary metric:** Median Individual Full-Time Earnings ($63,128)
**Why:** Represents "one year of YOUR labor" - not blended with spouse/household

### **Income Selection Options (Planned):**
- [x] Median Income (default) - $63,128
- [ ] Minimum Wage - $15,080 (Phase 2)
- [ ] Household Income toggle - $83,730 (Phase 2)

### **Why This Works:**
- ✅ Removes inflation confusion
- ✅ Makes time/labor the fundamental currency
- ✅ Creates intuitive fractions (1/3 car vs "$18,000")
- ✅ Builds emotional weight (fractions = months of your life)
- ✅ Bypasses partisan talking points
- ✅ Impossible to argue with - it's pure math

### **Visual Representation (Updated with Real Data):**
```
1Y in 1950 (Median Household: $3,216):
🏠 House:      ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░ 2.3 years (27.6 months)
🚗 New Car:    ▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░ 0.47 years (5.6 months)
🎓 College:    ▓░░░░░░░░░ 0.04 years (0.5 months)
💰 Savings:    ▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░ Possible

1Y in 2025 (Median Household: $83,730):
🏠 House:      ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ 4.9 years (58.6 months)
🚗 New Car:    ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 0.57 years (6.9 months)
🎓 College:    ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░ 1.29 years (15.4 months)
💰 Savings:    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ ~0 of 1Y
