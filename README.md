# ONE YEAR - What Does Your Year Really Buy?

An interactive web application that visualizes how purchasing power has changed over time, comparing the cost of essential goods and services to median annual earnings.

## Overview

This project helps users understand economic changes by showing how many "years of work" (1Y = one median worker's annual salary) it takes to afford various items across different decades, from 1950 to 2025.

## Features

- **Purchasing Power Calculator**: Compare costs of housing, education, healthcare, and more across decades
- **Wealth Gap Visualization**: See how CEO-to-worker pay ratios have changed over time
- **Myth Busters**: Data-driven responses to common generational talking points
- **Interactive Timeline**: Slider to explore different years and see how costs have changed
