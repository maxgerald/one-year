# ONE YEAR - Project Outline

## 🎯 Project Vision

A financial literacy tool that helps people understand and discuss economic changes across generations by introducing a new unit of measurement: **1Y (One Year)** = one median worker's annual salary.

By normalizing everything to "years of work" instead of dollars, we bypass inflation confusion and make economic reality visceral and personal.

---

## 🎭 Two-Act Structure

### **Act 1: The Personal Hook** (Primary Experience)
*"Why can't I afford what my parents could?"*

**Purpose:** Build trust and personal connection through relatable purchasing power comparisons
**Tone:** Educational, empathetic, "let's figure this out together"
**Focus:** Individual worker's purchasing power across time

**Key Message:** "Your grandparents weren't better with money. The math was just different."

### **Act 2: The Context** (Secondary Discovery)
*"Oh... THAT'S where it went"*

**Purpose:** Contextualize personal economic squeeze within systemic wealth concentration
**Tone:** Factual but sharp, data-driven revelation
**Focus:** Wealth inequality and concentration over same time period

**Key Message:** "Worker productivity tripled. Wages stayed flat. The economy grew. Where did it go?"

---

## 📏 Core Innovation: The 1Y (One Year) Unit

### **Definition:**
- **1Y** = One median worker's annual salary for that year
- Always normalized to contemporary prices
- Represents actual TIME of worker's life

### **Why This Works:**
- ✅ Removes inflation confusion
- ✅ Makes time/labor the fundamental currency
- ✅ Creates intuitive fractions (1/3 car vs "$18,000")
- ✅ Builds emotional weight (fractions = months of your life)
- ✅ Bypasses partisan talking points
- ✅ Impossible to argue with - it's pure math

### **Icon/Logo: Circle Badge with "1Y"**
**Final Design Decision:** Circle badge with "1Y" centered

**Design Specifications:**
- Clean circle with "1Y" in center
- Heavy geometric sans-serif typeface
- Thin border, ample breathing room
- Suggests official standard/unit of measurement

**Primary Version:**
- Deep navy circle (#1a3a52) with white "1Y"
- For use on white/light backgrounds

**Alternate Version:**
- White circle with navy "1Y" 
- For use on dark backgrounds

**Accent Version:**
- Navy circle with white "1Y" + thin burnt orange border (#e67e22)
- For emphasis/CTAs

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Scales perfectly at any size (tiny avatar to billboard)
- ✅ Suggests official measurement standard
- ✅ Professional and trustworthy
- ✅ Easy to reproduce (stickers, merch, social media)
- ✅ Not trying too hard - lets concept speak for itself

### **Visual Representation:**
```
1Y in 1950:
🏠 House:      ▓▓▓░░░░░░░ 1/4 of 1Y (3 months)
🚗 New Car:    ▓▓▓▓░░░░░░ 1/3 of 1Y (4 months)
🥖 Groceries:  ▓▓░░░░░░░░ 1/5 of 1Y (2.5 months)
💰 Savings:    ▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░ 3/10 of 1Y

1Y in 2025:
🏠 House:      ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░ 6+ 1Y (IMPOSSIBLE)
🚗 New Car:    ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░ 2/3 of 1Y (8 months)
🥖 Groceries:  ▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 1/3 of 1Y (4 months)
💰 Savings:    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ ~0 of 1Y
