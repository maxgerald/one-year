---

### **About Page**

```
[Circle Badge Logo]

ONE YEAR

We created a new way to talk about purchasing power: 
the Year.

One Year (1Y) = one median worker's annual salary.

By measuring everything in Years instead of dollars, 
we cut through inflation confusion and make economic 
changes personal.

Want to know how many Years it took to buy a house 
in 1960 vs. today? We'll show you.

Every number is sourced from the Census Bureau, Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, and authoritative economic data.

This isn't opinion. It's math.

Built for people who feel the economic squeeze but 
lack the data to explain it.

Now you have the numbers.
```

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

### **Messaging Don'ts**

❌ **Never:**
- Use "eat the rich" rhetoric or class warfare language
- Make it overtly partisan (no "thanks Obama" or "late-stage capitalism")
- Oversimplify complex economics into good guys vs. bad guys
- Claim to have all the answers or solutions
- Present opinion as fact
- Shame people for their economic circumstances
- Use sarcasm about serious economic hardship

❌ **Avoid:**
- Excessive emojis (1-2 max per post)
- All caps (except for brand name "ONE YEAR")
- Clickbait ("You won't BELIEVE what happened in 1975!")
- Fear-mongering ("The economy is COLLAPSING!")
- Conspiracy theories
- Economic jargon without explanation

---

### **Visual Don'ts**

❌ **Never:**
- Use the logo on busy backgrounds without a container
- Stretch or distort the circle badge
- Add effects (gradients, drop shadows, 3D)
- Use colors outside the approved palette
- Set body text below 16px
- Use decorative fonts
- Overcrowd layouts
- Use stock photos of "sad millennials with avocado toast"

---

### **Tone Don'ts**

❌ **Never sound:**
- Condescending ("Obviously, you don't understand economics...")
- Preachy ("What you NEED to understand is...")
- Dismissive ("Stop complaining and just work harder")
- Hopeless ("Everything is terrible and there's no point")
- Conspiratorial ("THEY don't want you to know...")

---

## 📊 Brand Personality

If ONE YEAR were a person:

**They would be:**
- A patient teacher who's genuinely excited about data
- Your smart friend who can explain economics without jargon
- Someone who validates your frustration with facts
- Curious, not cynical
- Angry about injustice but not performatively outraged

**They would NOT be:**
- A politician with an agenda
- An influencer chasing engagement
- A doomer preaching apocalypse
- A corporate spokesperson spinning stats
- A condescending academic

**Their superpower:**
Making complex economics feel personal and understandable

**Their weakness:**
Sometimes so focused on data accuracy that emotional resonance takes a backseat (we're working on balancing both)

---
